# Limit Definition of a Derivative
Short little animation of the limit definition of a derivative.
I like to coin the moment when my AP calculus teacher showed us this derivation as the moment that I fell in love with math. I already knew what the definition was at that point, but it felt so abstract and made up, but when he showed us this, I was in awe at how intuitive and genius this derivation was. I remember sitting in class with one of my closest friends, and both of us were filled with complete wonder from how beautiful this derivation was. From then on, I knew I was going to love the rest of not only calculus, but math as a whole.
